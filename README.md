# Custom-Desktop-Environments
Just one or more desktop environment configs I have been working on. 

For now, I am focused on LabWC and Waybar. There will be configs for laptops as well as desktops. I may try to future-proof configs for mobile based on Waybar's abilities, but I can make no guarantees it will work. 

In this project, I am not going to rely on Font Awesome. While a great tool, it's not 100% free. Their filenames contain their unicode to make them a drop-in replacement for existing projects once they are converted to a font.
