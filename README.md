# Custom-Desktop-Environments
Just one or more desktop environment configs I have been working on. 

For now, I am focused on LabWC and Waybar. There will be configs for laptops as well as desktops. I may try to future-proof configs for mobile based on Waybar's abilities, but I can make no guarantees it will work.
